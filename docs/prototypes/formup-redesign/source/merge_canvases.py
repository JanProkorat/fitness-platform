"""Merge the three Form Up canvases (web, client app, coach app) into project/ for the exporters.

Usage: python3 merge_canvases.py <web_dir> <client_dir> <coach_dir>
Each <dir> holds project/canvas.json and project/*.dc.html downloaded from one canvas.
The exporters expect one canvas with the pages web, glass, coach and email, so every module page
of a canvas is stacked under its app page, row title 300 px above its row. The concepts and logo
pages are not on the new canvases; their boards and notes are kept from the current project/.
