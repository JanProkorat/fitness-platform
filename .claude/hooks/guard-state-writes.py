"""guard-state-writes.py — only the main thread (conductor) may write shared
pipeline state. Subagents may only write their own handoff file.

WHEN DOES THIS RUN?
  This is a PreToolUse hook for Write and Edit tool calls.
  It only acts on files inside the ".claude/state/" directory — all other
  file writes pass through immediately without inspection.

WHAT DOES IT DO?
  The pipeline uses a shared state file (pipeline.json) that only the conductor
  (main Claude session) should update. If a subagent could write it freely, it
  could corrupt or hijack the pipeline. This hook enforces:
    - Main thread: unrestricted writes to .claude/state/
    - Subagents: ONLY their own handoff file (see ACCEPTED FILENAMES below)
    - Everything else from a subagent: DENY

WHY HANDOFF FILES?
  Handoff files are how subagents communicate results back to the conductor.
  A subagent writes "handoff-developer.json" with its output; the conductor
  reads it, validates it, and updates pipeline.json itself.

ACCEPTED FILENAMES (and why the set is wider than the agent type alone)
  This repo's .claude/CLAUDE.md instructs two workflow agents to write a
  PER-ISSUE handoff — rule 5.5 names `state/handoff-design-<issue>.json` and
  rule 6.5 names `state/handoff-qa-<issue>.json`. Those use a SHORT STEM
  ("design", "qa") rather than the full agent type ("design-reviewer",
  "qa-tester"), so an agent-type-only match denied every documented write and
  the verdict silently fell back to the generic filename. Two concurrent QA
  dispatches would then overwrite each other's verdict.

  So each agent type maps to a small, fixed set of allowed stems (its own type
  plus any documented short form), and the filename may carry an optional
  `-WI-<N>` or `-<issue>` numeric suffix:

    handoff-qa-tester.json        handoff-qa-857.json
    handoff-design-reviewer.json  handoff-design-857.json
    handoff-backend-dotnet.json   handoff-backend-dotnet-WI-3.json

  The suffix is digits only, and the stems are per-agent-type, so this stays a
  strict widening: a subagent still cannot write pipeline.json, and cannot
  write a DIFFERENT agent's handoff (e.g. backend-dotnet cannot forge the QA
  verdict). If you add an agent whose documented handoff stem differs from its
  type, add it to AGENT_FILENAME_STEMS — do not loosen the pattern.

EXIT CODES (Claude Code hook contract):
  0 = allow the write to proceed
  (deny is communicated via stdout JSON — exit code stays 0)
