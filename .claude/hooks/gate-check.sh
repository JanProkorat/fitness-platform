# gate-check.sh — SubagentStop hook.
#
# Runs after every Agent dispatch returns to the orchestrator. If the
# subagent wrote a handoff file under .claude/state/handoff-*.json,
# validate it against its declared schema before letting control flow
# back. A schema-violating handoff exits non-zero so the agent sees
# the error and self-corrects.
#
# How we find the handoff:
#   The hook receives a JSON payload on stdin carrying agent_id /
#   agent_type / transcript_path. We look for a handoff file in
#   .claude/state/ that matches the agent_type prefix AND was written
#   during this agent's run. If none exists we exit cleanly — not every
#   dispatch produces a handoff (ad-hoc Explore queries, or a dispatch
#   the orchestrator told to reply in prose).
#
# Why the run-window check (#910):
#   This used to take whichever prefix-matching file had the newest
#   mtime, with no check that the agent had actually written it. Two
#   consequences, both observed in this repo's own log:
#     - a dispatch that writes no handoff gets gated against a NEIGHBOUR's
#       file (2026-08-06: a pr-reviewer run on PR #908 validated
#       handoff-review-894.json; a qa-tester run on #906 validated
#       handoff-qa-898.json);
#     - conversely a PASS proved nothing about the current agent, and one
#       invalid file left on disk blocked every later dispatch of that
#       agent type until someone noticed.
#   The payload carries no issue number, so we cannot key on the issue
#   directly. We use the transcript's birth time as the agent's start
#   instead: anything the agent wrote must be at least that new. Where the
#   filesystem cannot report a birth time we say so in the log rather than
#   silently falling back to the old guess.
