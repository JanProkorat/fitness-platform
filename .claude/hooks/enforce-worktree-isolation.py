"""enforce-worktree-isolation.py — PreToolUse[Write|Edit|MultiEdit] hook.

Stop a subagent from editing package source in the MAIN checkout while
worktree-based parallel work is in flight.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  On 2026-08-16/17 a batch of eight issues ran in parallel, each dispatched
  to its own `.worktrees/<issue>-<slug>/` per rules/branch-and-pr.md. FOUR
  dev subagents nonetheless edited the MAIN checkout instead:

    - #902's agent edited main, then ran build+test against its worktree —
      so its first green run was measured against unmodified code. It caught
      that itself and re-applied, but only by luck of noticing.
    - #935's agent wrote its entire P1 production sweep (33 files) into main
      while its assigned worktree sat empty. Had it committed, a P1 timezone
      fix would have landed on a docs branch.
    - #897's agent did the same and reverted.
    - The stray files in main then poisoned an UNRELATED review: #798's
      blind reviewer invoked the `review` skill, which resolved paths against
      the session cwd, read main's uncommitted backend work, and returned
      findings about files belonging to a different issue entirely.

  The dispatch prompt naming the worktree is a suggestion; a `cd` at the top
  of a prompt is not a constraint. This hook is the constraint.

DETECTION
  Same subagent detection as deny-subagent-merge.py: Claude Code passes
  agent_id / agent_type / subagent_type in the payload when a subagent is
  running; transcripts under "/subagent/" are the fallback signal.

SCOPE — deliberately narrow, to avoid false denials
  Only three package roots are guarded: backend/, web/, mobile/. Subagents
  legitimately write elsewhere in the main checkout — most importantly the
  handoff JSONs under `.claude/state/`, plus `.qa-artifacts/`. Those are
  untouched.

  The guard only engages while at least one `.worktrees/*` exists. When no
  worktrees are in play, rules/branch-and-pr.md#serial-dispatch explicitly
  permits a sequential agent to reuse the main working tree, so denying
  would be wrong.

ESCAPE HATCH
  Set FP_ALLOW_MAIN_TREE_EDITS=1 to disable. Intended for a deliberate
  serial dispatch that must use main while unrelated worktrees happen to
  exist — not for routine use.

OUTPUT PROTOCOL
  Matches block-generated-client.py and deny-subagent-merge.py: a denial is
  one JSON object on stdout with hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision =
  "deny", then exit 0. An allow writes nothing, also exit 0. The decision is
  carried by the JSON, never by the exit code.
