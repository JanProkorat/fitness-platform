"""reinject-state.py — on SessionStart (compact|clear|resume|startup), print
current pipeline phase + gate so Claude picks them up.

WHEN DOES THIS RUN?
  Claude Code fires "SessionStart" at the beginning of every session, including
  when a session is resumed after context compaction (Claude's memory was summarised),
  after /clear, or when the IDE restarts. At that point, Claude has lost the
  in-conversation state about which pipeline phase is active.

WHAT DOES IT DO?
  It reads the pipeline.json state file and prints its key fields to stdout.
  Claude Code injects that stdout text back into the conversation as context,
  so Claude "remembers" where the pipeline was even after a reset.
  Project conventions live in CLAUDE.md (auto-loaded) and .claude/rules/*.md
  (these do NOT auto-load — an agent must Read them explicitly); this hook
  does not reinject rule content itself, only a pointer to go Read it.

WHY IS THIS NEEDED?
  LLMs are stateless between sessions. The pipeline state lives in files on disk.
  This hook bridges the gap by surfacing the on-disk state into the conversation.

EXIT CODE:
  0 = success (always; this hook is informational only)

Ported 1:1 from reinject-state.sh (an earlier project's .claude/hooks).
