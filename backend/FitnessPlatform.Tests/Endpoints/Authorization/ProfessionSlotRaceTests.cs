/// Concurrency coverage for the one-active-coach-per-profession invariant (#1009).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// #980 added the application-level guard, but the guard's read and the link insert were two
/// separate autocommitting statements: under READ COMMITTED two concurrent requests could both
/// observe the slot as free and both insert. #1009 wraps the pair in a transaction that first
/// takes a <c>FOR NO KEY UPDATE</c> row lock on the client's own <c>client_profiles</c> row —
/// the only row both racers are guaranteed to touch, since neither can see the other's
/// uncommitted link.
///
/// Two tests, deliberately at different levels. The first pins the MECHANISM deterministically
/// (the second racer really does block on the first, and really does see the winner's link once
/// it commits). The second pins the OUTCOME through the HTTP surface. Only the first is
/// timing-independent; the second can serialize by luck on a given run, which is why it is not
/// the only coverage here.
///
/// A third test covered the same race on CreateCollaborationEndpoint. That endpoint let a coach
/// mint an active link for another professional to their client with no client consent, which
/// contradicts the rule that only the client chooses their coaches — it was deleted, and its
/// race test with it.
