/// <summary>
/// Anonymous endpoint for requesting a verification-email resend, keyed by email
/// address instead of an authenticated session (#679). Unblocks the resend
/// affordance on RegisterStep4 (web #621), where the user has no access token yet.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// No-enumeration contract (hard requirement — see design review #679): every
/// branch below — unregistered email, already-verified account, throttled
/// (rolling-window cap), and a real send — returns the SAME 200 with the SAME
/// generic body. Do not add a differing field (e.g. a remaining-resends counter)
/// or throw the <see cref="ErrorCodes.EmailAlreadyVerified"/> /
/// <see cref="ErrorCodes.VerificationResendLimitReached"/> codes the authenticated
/// <c>/auth/resend-verification</c> endpoint uses — those would turn the response
/// into an account-existence oracle. The residual timing side-channel flagged at
/// #679 (the unverified branch used to await an SMTP round-trip; the other
/// branches returned immediately) is closed by #702: the token is still issued
/// SYNCHRONOUSLY (keeps the rolling-window throttle count accurate and guarantees
/// the token row exists even if the send is later dropped), but the SMTP send
/// itself is enqueued fire-and-forget onto <see cref="IBackgroundEmailQueue"/> and
/// processed by <c>EmailDispatchWorker</c> off the request path — so all four
/// branches now return in roughly constant time.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Anti-abuse gate (security-review follow-up, #679): this endpoint does NOT gate
/// on <see cref="ApplicationUser.VerificationEmailsSent"/> (the lifetime counter
/// the AUTHENTICATED resend endpoint enforces). Because this endpoint is
/// anonymous, any caller who knows a victim's email could otherwise drive that
/// lifetime counter to its cap and permanently lock the victim out of ever
/// getting a verification email again through ANY channel — an anonymous
/// denial-of-verification. Instead this endpoint is throttled on RECENT activity:
/// at most <see cref="MaxSendsPerWindow"/> sends per rolling <see cref="Window"/>
/// (read from existing <see cref="EmailVerificationToken"/> rows — no new table,
/// no migration). A short inter-send cooldown was considered but deliberately
/// dropped: it would also block the common legitimate case of a user clicking
/// "resend" seconds after registering because the first email did not arrive —
/// exactly the scenario this endpoint exists to unblock. The window cap alone
/// already bounds daily volume. The token service call passes
/// <c>countTowardLifetimeCap: false</c> so this path can never advance the
/// authenticated endpoint's cap, bounding anonymous abuse to a nuisance (at
/// most <see cref="MaxSendsPerWindow"/> emails per rolling day) rather than a
/// permanent lockout.
