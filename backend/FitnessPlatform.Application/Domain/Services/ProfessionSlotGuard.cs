/// Occupancy is derived from the link's own <c>CanViewNutritionPlans</c> /
/// <c>CanViewTrainingPlans</c> pair — never from <c>ProfessionalRole</c> (a single
/// tie-broken display label that misclassifies dual-role professionals) and never from
/// the professional's global identity roles (which over-claim for a link deliberately
/// scoped NutritionOnly/TrainingOnly). Every call site already computes these two flags
/// as held roles narrowed by the caller-requested scope before reaching this guard —
/// pass those computed values, not the roles themselves.

/// <b>There is no exemption.</b> A previous version of this guard took a COLLECTION of

/// the caller and the collaborator, on the theory that a collaboration-minted link was a
/// delegated grant rather than a second coach competing for the slot (#980). That
/// endpoint let a coach mint an active link for another professional to their client with
/// no client consent, which contradicts the product rule that only the client chooses
/// their coaches — it was deleted, and the two-exclusion form went with it. The rule is
/// now absolute: a client never holds two active coaches in one profession, delegated or
/// not. Do not reintroduce a multi-exclusion overload without a product decision that
/// says the rule has an exception.
