/// <summary>
/// Background service that drains <see cref="IBackgroundEmailQueue"/> and performs the
/// actual SMTP/provider send (#702). Introduced so the anonymous resend-verification
/// endpoint can enqueue a send and return immediately instead of awaiting the network
/// round-trip in the request path — see <see cref="IBackgroundEmailQueue"/> for why.
///
/// <para>
/// Mirrors <see cref="SocialLoginNonceReaperService"/>'s scope-per-item pattern: this
/// worker never captures the request's <see cref="CancellationToken"/> (it would already
/// be cancelled by the time this runs, since the request has completed) and never
/// captures the request-scoped <see cref="IEmailService"/> (disposed along with the
/// request's DI scope). Instead every dequeued item is processed inside a fresh scope
/// created from <see cref="IServiceScopeFactory"/>.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// Graceful shutdown drain (#705): on host shutdown, <c>stoppingToken</c> cancelling used
/// to make <c>ReadAllAsync</c> throw <see cref="OperationCanceledException"/> immediately,
/// dropping any items still buffered in the channel plus a send that was in flight. Now
/// <see cref="IBackgroundEmailQueue.Complete"/> closes the channel writer on shutdown (new
/// enqueues start failing cleanly — see <see cref="IBackgroundEmailQueue.Complete"/>), while
/// the read loop itself runs on <see cref="CancellationToken.None"/> so it keeps draining the
/// already-buffered items and completes naturally once they're exhausted, instead of being
/// torn down by cancellation. Each send also runs on <see cref="CancellationToken.None"/> so
/// an in-flight/drained send finishes rather than being cancelled mid-send.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// Why the drain is owned by <see cref="StopAsync"/> and not by <c>ExecuteAsync</c> (#866):
/// <see cref="BackgroundService.StartAsync"/> does not call <c>ExecuteAsync</c> inline — it
/// schedules it as <c>Task.Run(() =&gt; ExecuteAsync(_stoppingCts.Token), _stoppingCts.Token)</c>.
/// Passing a cancellation token to <c>Task.Run</c> means that if the token is already cancelled
/// when the thread pool dequeues the work item, the delegate is <em>discarded</em> and
/// <c>ExecuteAsync</c> never runs at all — not even a <c>finally</c> inside it. A shutdown that
/// begins before the pool picks the worker up therefore drops every buffered item, which is
/// exactly the guarantee #705 set out to make. Placing the drain in <see cref="StopAsync"/>,
/// which the host always awaits, makes it independent of whether <c>ExecuteAsync</c> ever ran.
/// The drain still has no timer of its own: it stays bounded by <c>HostOptions.ShutdownTimeout</c>,
/// which cancels the token handed to <see cref="StopAsync"/> — at which point the drain stops
/// picking up new items but never cancels a send already under way.
